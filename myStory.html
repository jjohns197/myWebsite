        <p>To whom it may concern, <br><br>
       
            Thank you! Not only for existing as a platform, but for providing the opportunity for everyday citizens like myself to
             make drastic changes in life. The Uber platform for ride-share drivers has been, and continues to be a blessing for me.
              One of the key elements that has made Uber such a perfect match is flexibility in respect to time management, this has 
              given me the opportunity to go back to school and finish my degree. All this without taking a huge deficit in the pocket.
            <br><br>
            My name is Joshua Johnson, I have been working for the Uber platform for the past 8 years (on and off). My experience so 
            far working with the platform has been life changing (to say the least). My mother had a major stroke back in 2009, this
            unfortunately left  her paralyzed on her left side, which made her permanently disabled. I moved to Maryland for this very 
            reason, to be as support system for my mother. It was difficult for me to find a job, stay in school, and be that support 
            system for my mother. As a result, unfortunately I had to put school on the  back burner and get a job while supporting my 
            mom. This was my life for about 7 years, however I always wanted to go back to school and finish my education. I never wanted 
            to be one of those individuals who’d always say “I’ll going to go back eventually” or “next summer for sure” (we all know someone
            like that). It wasn’t until 20016 when I found out about Uber and the vehicle leasing option that was available at the time. 
            This allowed me to do a few things. One being able to have a vehicle solution to get to work and back quicker and more efficiently.
            Two, also giving me the opportunity to take my mother to doctor visits and be an overall support package for my mom (being able 
            to take her out to dinner in my car was also priceless). I did have a full time job at Enterprise Car Rental when I first started 
            Uber and was having difficulty fulfilling my dream of completing school and earning my bachelor’s degree. Life was still pretty rough,
            I struggled with family issues and scheduling complications with my job. This made it nearly impossible to try to go back to school 
            and be successful. I eventually started making more money from Uber then I was making at my full-time job at Enterprise (almost double).
            As a result, I began doing Uber full time. There are no words to express how thankful I am to have found your platform. I originally 
            started with one of your original vehicle lease option programs. Ever since then, the Uber platform has been like a blessing. I was able 
            to help my family with transportation necessities, go back and finish school, and most importantly, I had the freedom to live my life with 
            “me at the sterling wheel” (no pun intended).

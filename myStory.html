        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>To whom it may concern,</b> <br><br>
       
            My name is Joshua Johnson, and I am a Computer Science graduate from Towson University. I have had the privilege of 
            navigating a challenging, yet rewarding journey to complete my education, and I am eager to apply my skills and experiences
            to a professional role in the tech industry.
            <br><br>
            My academic journey began at Vincennes University, but I paused my education when my mother had a stroke in 2009. This pivotal 
            moment led me to focus on helping my family, and I relocated to Annapolis, Maryland, to support my mom during her recovery.
            During this time, I worked to support myself and my family, all while remaining committed to one goal: finishing my education.
            <br><br>
            After enrolling at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC), I juggled full-time work and studies, determined to pursue a degree 
            that would combine my passion for computers, electronics, and problem-solving. Over time, I took on various jobs, including at 
            Capital One and Best Buy, before discovering Uber. Uber provided the flexibility I needed to focus on school, and eventually, I 
            made the decision to work full-time with Uber while continuing my studies.
            <br><br>
            In the summer of 2024, I graduated from Towson University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. This achievement represents my 
            perseverance and passion for learning. Throughout my journey, I have developed strong technical skills in areas such as front-end
            development, SQL, database management, and software engineering. My passion for technology, paired with my diverse work experience, 
            has equipped me with a unique perspective on problem-solving and teamwork.
            <br><br>
            I am confident that my determination, technical skills, and life experiences will allow me to contribute effectively to any team I join. 
            I am excited about the opportunity to continue learning and growing in a professional setting, and I am open to new challenges that will 
            allow me to apply my knowledge in meaningful ways.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of working together.
            <br><br><br><br>

            Sincerely, <br>
            Joshua Johnson
